					</p>
					<p> In the past year since we have updated, so much has happened it's hard to sum it all up.  e-Grips were all over comp walls in 2011 from ABS Nationals in Boulder to the Nor'easter in Burlington, Vermont and in Central Park for the EMS Pro in between.  The most recent event we sponsored was the first Lead World Cup in over 20 years, which our e-Grips Sales Captain Chris Danielson was the Chief US Routesetter for.  Check out the video! </a></p>

					<p>We apologize for not updating all of the new sets, but, for those that have been part of the family, getting new shapes each month, e-Grips First Dibs program has been as popular as ever.  For those of you interested in First Dibs, you can always contact Chris Danielson at <a href="mailto:cdanielson@gthi.com">cdanielson@gthi.com</a> for any info about the most recent sets or any e-Grips questions in general.  We will be updating the individual website pages over the coming weeks with all of the new sets shown below.  Here are pictures of all of the First Dibs from 2011 and the last months of 2010, all now available as a part of the complete e-Grips line:

						We have had a bunch of other new sets too of course!  The Bubble Wrap Beehive and Jibber Jabber Super Jugs were released just in advance of ABS Nationals last season.  The Beehive speaks for itself and has already been featured in dozens of competitions.  The Jibber Jabber Super Jugs is a set of 5 deeply incut single-hand jugs, perfect for easy climbing on steep walls.  All the shapes in this set were modeled after the near-perfect single shape from the original Jibber Jabbers - those of you that have the set know which one we're talking about!

						A new theme we also added last year, is a Training style of shapes - purely symmetrical shapes for left or right hands - function oriented - great for the System Board or home training wall, but also great to force movements, as was shown in the Lead World Cup in Boulder, where the Men's Final had the top climbers in the world spinning around on bright orange Pure Power Pockets II.  We may expand on this line in the future, but for now we have four sets - Pure Power Edges I and II, and Pure Power Pockets I and II.  Enjoy!

			<p>
				Last month on a brilliant autumn afternoon, the top boulderers in the US battled at the Nor'easter, and these climbers were some of the first to climb on new e-Grips shapes!  The <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/limestone/myorcan-tufapinch.html">Myorcan TufaPinch</a> and <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/limestone/myorcan-slopers.html">Myorcan Slopers</a>, featured in Menâs Final #2 in the UBC finale competition, have just recently been added to our full line, along with eight other amazing sets.  Check out the highlight reel from the competition (around minute 5:30) to see the grips in action:
			</p>
			<p>
				Along with the Myorcan themed shapes added in 2010, this summer and fall we have also added to the Limestone family a new set of sloper-pinch grabs called <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/limestone/lunar-loaves.html">Lunar Loaves</a>.  In the Artistic family, there are four new sets with unique styles.  The <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/artistic/butterdish-buckets.html">Butterdish Buckets</a>, with a curved line aesthetic reminiscent of the <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/artistic/salad-dishes.html">Salad</a> and <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/artistic/soup-dishes.html">Soup Dishes</a>, is just out for October.  Another three sets that have been featured in our First Dibs subscription plan have recently been added to the Artistic line:  The <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/artistic/turtle-mini-jugs.html">Turtle Mini-Jugs</a> offer unique sloping jug grabs with subtle finger catches.  The <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/artistic/side-dishes-2.html">Side Dishes II</a>, featured at the 2010 Vail World Cup and Mechanical Pinches, highlighted in ABS Nationals last winter, are incredible new shapes as well.  
			</p>
			<p>
				And if you're looking for grips to train for your next project in Hueco or Joe's Valley, we've got more for you...  To the Granite line, we've added the <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/granite/real-hueco-incuts.html">Real Hueco Incuts</a>, a simple set of five crimps and pinches with the refined real rock carving style.  And to our Sandstone family, we've got two sets added - the <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/sandstone/joes-little-ones.html">Joe's Little Ones</a>, a big set of twenty great for crimps or monster footholds, and a classic set refurbished nearly ten years later, the <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/sandstone/joes-classic-jugs.html">Joe's Classic Jugs</a>.  (For the hold-fanatics among you, Joe's Classic Jugs include the infamous two-finger "Dream Pocket"...)

						New e-Grips Shapes
						</p>
						<p>We have new sets in every single e-Grips category  This spring, we've got tenacity and technique in mind, so all of these sets lend themselves towards getting stronger from slab to slightly overhanging walls - if you can hang onto these grips on anything steeper than that you seriously deserve a medal.</p>

						<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">NEW SETS! NEW SETS! NEW SETS!!!  AND 10% OFF ALL E-GRIPS WEB PURCHASES!<br><br>

						In the time between when the summer dwindled away and winter appeared by dumping two feet of snow in Colorado, e-Grips has unveiled a ton of new shapes, been sponsoring great local ABS competitions around the US, and are really proud to have hit and rolled well past the 1000 hold mark in our line.  To celebrate, weï¿½re offering 10% OFF ALL WEB PURCHASES!  Itï¿½ll only last for a short time, so take advantage now and get some new shapes for your home gym, your kidsï¿½ wall, or just as Christmas gifts to weight down the tree!<br><br>

						Weï¿½re soliciting feedback from our favorite setters and climbers across the country and would love to hear from you - WHAT ARE YOUR FAVORITE e-GRIPS THEMES OR SETS?  WHAT SHAPES WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IN 2010?  Email our National Gym Rep Chris Danielson at cdanielson@gthi.com with your ideas!<br>
						<br>

						But, back to the shapes, Itï¿½s been a long time coming, but weï¿½re psyched to have added 5 Routesetter Signature Sets to the eG line.  The Signature Sets were concepts from our sponsored team of routesetters and include some of the most unique shapes in the e-Grips line, representing our longstanding goal of supporting...and setting... the Standard.  WANT TO SEE THEM ALL RIGHT NOW?  Just click over to our <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/new/">NEW SHAPES</a> page.
						<br>
						<br>

						Chris Danielson, our Gym Rep and pro setter captain, nicknamed The Professor, always loved the <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/features/hueco-wonder-hole.html">Hueco Wonder Hole</a> and wanted to see more.  The result is a set of five amazing incut pockets great for forcing moves, called <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/signature/the-professor.html">Hueco Wonder Pockets</a>.  Mike Moelter, AKA Country Club, longtime eG setter and current Operations Manager for the amazing <a href="http://movementboulder.com/home/">Movement Climbing  and Fitness</a> in Boulder, Colorado - wanted some big match-able pinches - the result was a unique shaping partnership between an enigmatic French legend named Larry and the Professor himself, producing the <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/signature/country-club.html">Cornice Pinches</a>.  Jamie Emerson, the punk rock grown-up behind B3bouldering.com and a big fan of a little outcropping of Sandstone in Alabama, was eager to see some new slopers - and, voila - the <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/signature/punk-rock.html">Horse Pens Giants</a> (Check out how small the carabiner is in the picture - YES, these holds are BIG!).  Grizzled veteran routesetter Pit Bull Lance Hadfield came up with a great idea for system-inspired <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/signature/pit-bull.html">Mirror Slopers </a>, and Kynan Waggoner, the Urban Cowboy of USA Climbing, wanted to add some 2Tex to a popular theme - thus the <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/signature/urban-cowboy.html">2Tex Bubble Wrap Edges </a>.

						<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">And thatï¿½s not all! Also new to the e-Grips line is an amazing new theme of shapes called Remarkable Rocks.  Inspired by a real destination called Kangaroo Island, with incredibly cool rock formations, Ryan Spence brought this theme to life with a set of amazing <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/granite/remarkable-roof-jugs.html"> Roof Jugs</a>, <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/granite/remarkable-medium-jugs.html">Jugs</a>, and Scoops.  The Scoops were a recent exclusive monthly set and will be available soon, OR you can get it now at the discounted price by signing up for e-Grips <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/first-dibs.html">FIRST DIBS!</a></span></p>

						Coming up in 2010, e-Grips will be all over the place.  Look out for e-Grips shapes at the ABS Regional events in mid-January all over the country.  If youï¿½re out at the Salt Lake City Outdoor Retailer show in late January, head to Momentum Climbing Gym to compete or watch the likes of Paul Robinson, Joe Kinder, Carlo Traversi, Alex Puccio, Emily Harrington and Paige Claasen compete in the <a href="http://www.scsnationals.org/">Adult SCS Nationals</a>.  Chris Danielson and Kevin Branford will be routesetting and you can expect to see some awesome e-Grips shapes on the routes!  Soon after that, e-Grips will be highlighted yet again at the premier bouldering event of the winter season, the ABS Nationals!

If you're part of the First Dibs Family, you've seen these shapes already ï¿½ but if not, also check them out on the First Dibs page along with many of the other new sets, including most recently the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Peabody Crimps</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold;">Zen Garden Stones</span>.  We work really hard to make a diverse selection of sets as part of First Dibs, and put the customer first.  If you havenï¿½t gotten on <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/first-dibs.html">First Dibs</a>, youï¿½re missing out.  For $40/month with shipping included, weï¿½re introducing the best, most unique and functional sets, sometimes a set of 5, sometimes 10 or 20ï¿½ sometimes just one amazing feature.  Bottom line, itï¿½s always a deal.  If you total a years worth of First Dibs sets, the average retail price is nearly $60.00 (plus shipping) ï¿½ but if you sign up for First Dibs, youï¿½re getting all those sets for $40.00  </p>

Keep your eyes peeled for new sets in the coming months like the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Caterpillar Instars</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">Peabody Ledges</span>, and other surprise setsï¿½ like <span style="font-weight:bold;">Remarkable Rocks</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">Hueco Wonder Hole Minis</span>, and a new <span style="font-weight:bold;">Bubble Wrap</span> feature hold thatï¿½s so cool, it might out-sell the original.</p>

ABS Nationals was an amazing even this past February - Chris Danielson, Kynan Waggoner, and Jamie Emerson all putting up some excellent routes on the wall.  e-Grips Menï¿½s Final 4 was a standout, with a "rose dyno" to a <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/artistic/jibber-jabber-jugs.html">Jibber Jabber Jug</a>, then a "double clutch" to two <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/features/bubble-wrap-pinch-wedge.html">Bubble Wrap Pinch Wedges</a>.<br class="clear"/></p>

We finally got some time to catch up on things: so hereï¿½s a short recap of highlights including new sets in the line, more new shapes coming up!:</span></p>
							<p><span class="emphasis">Shapes</span> - Of course, new shapes are always coming in.  Formerly released to the exclusive First Dibs family but now available to the public - the <span class="emphasis">Font Slopes</span> are perhaps the best Fontainbleau-inspired shapes out there: big, slapping slopers, but intricate and technical, in classic e-Grips fashion.  The <span class="emphasis">Baby Bubble Wraps</span> are an awesome set of 20 small technical shapes with two different bubble types - superb for sloping arï¿½tes, or balance work on slabs or vert.  The <span class="emphasis">Dimple Dot Jugs</span> fill out the Pure Line for the year, with 5 simple, super-friendly rounded jug grabs.  And entirely new to all, the INCREDIBLE <span class="emphasis">Jibber Jabber Jugs</span> are a set of 3 roof jugs with the eG aesthetic ï¿½ 2 rings and the most amazing single handed incut jug youï¿½ve climbed on.  Check out all the new shapes <a target="_blank" href="http://www.e-grips.com/new/"><u>here!</u></a></p>
							<p><span class="emphasis">Routesetting and Competition Season</span>- Weï¿½re proud to be involved with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usaclimbing.net"><u>American Bouldering Series</u></a> again for another year of sponsorship of their great events.  The comps kicked off in September and the season is blasting along.  eGï¿½s Team Setter Chris Danielson just got back from instructing a couple big routesetting clinics up at a new gym called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.climbersrock.com"><u>Climberï¿½s Rock</u></a> in Canada and will be headed out to the third leg of the Triple Crown Bouldering Series in a couple weeks.  </p>
							<p>e-Grips is also making <span style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">brand new sets</span> specifically for the ABS Regionals which kick off all over the country in January where youï¿½ll likely see many <a target="_blank" href="http://www.e-grips.com/featured-setters/"><u>e-Grips Profiled Setters</u></a> turning wrenches!  Not long after those events, Chris will be setting the SCS Adult Nationals at the Winter Outdoor Retailer show in Salt Lake City with Profiled Setters Kevin Branford and Molly Beard.  And less a month later, eG Pro Team Setters Kynan Waggoner and Jamie Emerson team up, along with Chris, with PCA mastermind Scott Mechler and prolific New England setter Kyle McCabe - to set the standard at ABS Nationals!  Itï¿½s going to be a busy 2009!</p>

						<p>Iï¿½ve been routesetting for well over a decade, and working in recent years in competition climbing at major events with top North American climbers.ï¿½ Being able to
						set routes to challenge the likes of Sharma, Woods, Robinson, Puccio, Payne, Rands&hellip; and countless others, is amazing fun, and Iï¿½ve had
						the opportunity to test their skills on competition walls and when training for a few years now.ï¿½ But myself and other experienced setters
						have always wondered - how do the Americans stack up?ï¿½ How would we run against the Europeans - all of those seasoned World Cup climbers,
						with coaches, training regimes, V14 and 5.14 ascents, and the strength from experience, of competition confidence? <br/></p>
						<p>This past weekend in Vail, Colorado - the Teva Mountain Games hosted the first ever Bouldering World Cup on US soil - and we all found out.ï¿½ American climbers
						proved we can hold our own in international competition&hellip; and then some.ï¿½ And American setters took a step forward in the competition
						arena as well - the entire World Cup setting team being made up of e-Grips setters of course&hellip;<br/></p>
						<p>Americans fared amazingly well, with Alex Johnson WINNING the first World Cup sheï¿½s ever competed in, defeating Austrian powerhouse Anna Stohr and a field of countless
						other strong international women, as well as top Americans Alex Puccio, Lisa Rands, and young Tiffany Hensley (Hensley just missed the podium
						by one spot, finishing fourth).ï¿½ One half of the female finalists were American and four out of the top ten women were from the US!<br/></p>
						<p>Killian Fischhuber of Austria continued his reign in World Cup standings among the men, finishing first among an incredibly dense field.ï¿½ The boulder problems divided
						the field, but tightly, mostly with placements based on the number of attempts each climber made.ï¿½ Italian Gabiel Moroni placed second,
						finishing both the problems Fischhuber had, but taking one more attempt in his boulders than the Austrian had.<br/></p>
						<p>With a World Cup scoring system based on either reaching the "top" or the "zone", and placements split by the number of attempts needed to reach those markers, Paul
						Robinson, Frenchman Gerome Pouvreau, and Daniel Woods essentially tied in the third and final round - but their final rankings were split
						by the number of attempts each had made - and the same assessments from previous rounds.ï¿½ There was much debate among competitors and spectators
						alike about the scoring format, which left some climbers who had reached higher holds on a particular boulder, with no advantage, if many others
						had also reached the "zone", and perhaps with less attempts.<br/></p>
						<p>Chief American setter for the event, e-Grips team member Kynan Waggoner, worked closely with other top American setters also on the e-Grips team - Jamie Emerson and
						Mike Moelter - as well as International Chief Setter and all-around	nice guy Kim Donghyun, who had a wealth of World Cup and high-profile
						setting experience behind him prior to Teva.ï¿½ I headed up to Vail late in the week to help the World Cup team forerun the boulders, catching
						up with The Spotï¿½s Johnny Hork and the Southwestern "Compressor" Jon Cardwell, who themselves had been climbing relentlessly to help
						the team get the problems dialed.ï¿½ As is commonplace at Teva, the team found themselves up late nights, battling pouring rain, water dripping
						through t-nut holes in the wall, temperature swings of 40 + degrees, and blistering winds.ï¿½ But with the e-Grips crew behind it - they got it done!<br/></p>
						<p>In the end, the consensus was that the boulders were crushingly difficult - but the problems themselves were well-set, after three rounds, the competitors were fairly divided
						and had put on a great show, entertaining a crowd likely approaching, maybe even exceeding, 3,000 people.<br/></p>
						<p>An overwhelming sigh of relief was in order after the event, since the luck of the weather played a great role in its overall success.ï¿½ The rain put the pressure on
						the routesetters, and soaked a field of youth competitors for the Youth Competition, but the World Cup and Citizens Competitions went off with only minor delays.ï¿½ This event proved that American competitors
						and routesetters alike can step up seriously on the global stage, and weï¿½re psyched to see more in the future - from the e-Grips crew and the US Team alike!<br/></p>

						<p>Springtime has had a lot of eG action!  This past week, we just introduced 9 NEW sets into the full line.  The fresh new Peabody Granite line has the <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/granite/peabody-flakes.html">Flakes</a>, the <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/granite/peabody-pinches.html">Pinches</a>, and the big-time <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/features/peabody-crimp-plate.html">Peabody Crimp Plate</a>.  Ryan Spenceï¿½s turtle theme continues with some amazing new variations - the technical crimp and pinch sets <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/artistic/c-turtles.html">C-Turtles</a> and <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/artistic/tortoises.html">Tortoises</a>.  Add to that a sampling from each of the Pure, Limestone, and Artistic lines (<a href="http://www.e-grips.com/pure/geopinches.html">Geopinches</a>, <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/limestone/lunar-rounders.html">Lunar Rounders</a>, <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/artistic/bubble-wrap-ledges-2.html">Bubble Wrap Ledges II</a>, and <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/artistic/virus-mini-jugs.html">Virus Mini-Jugs</a>) and youï¿½ve got the eG line well over 800 unique shapes.</p>
						<p>e-Grips setters are taking strides to play our own American style of routesetting the world over.  Chris Danielson just got back from co-setting the <a href="http://www.climbing.com/news/hotflashes/sean_mccoll_and_thirza_carpenter_top_mec_canadian_bouldering_nationals/">Canadian Bouldering Nationals</a> in Edmonton, Alberta - turning some wild problems for all the top Canucks.  Another pro setter on our team - Kynan Waggoner, had his first hand at a World Cup in Austria, and will be Chief US Setter for the first American Bouldering World Cup in Vail at the <a href="http://www.tevamountaingames.com/ev_climb.cfm">Teva Mountain Games</a>, less than two weeks away.  This first WC is an entirely eG affair, when it comes to the routesetting - also on that official team will be eG setters Mike Moelter and Jamie Emerson, and Chris will be there for eG as a forerunner and to prep competitor Iso with some fashionably fresh grips.</p>
						<p>Be on the lookout in Vail for our team with the full Trango crew supporting at our booth as well, and only weeks later, Chris will be out in California at the USAC Youth Nationals at one of our favorite gyms - <a href="http://planetgranite.com/">Planet Granite</a>!

						<p>e-Grips in full force at hugely successful Routesetting Clinic and CWA Summit!</</p>
						<p>This past week was packed full with exciting climbing events in Boulder, Colorado.  In the very last days of April, our e-Grips Routesetting Professor Chris Danielson instructed the first USA Climbing Level II Routesetting Clinic of its kind at the world-renowned <a href="http://www.totalclimbing.com" target="_blank" >Boulder Rock Club</a>, and with fellow routesetter Mike Helt from <a href="http://www.routesetter.com " target="_blank" >www.routesetter.com</a> also instructing. e-Grips was a big sponsor of the event, getting some brand new exclusive holds into the hands of talented setters from all over the US.  Here's a shout out to the guys from some of the best gyms around - Adrenaline Climbing, Boulder Rock Club, Climb Time Towers, Peak Experiences, Rocks and Ropes, Stone Moves, and The Climbing Place!</p>
						<p>Following the USAC Clinic, Chris put on a half-day Routesetting Workshop for the second annual Climbing Wall Association Summit, which the GTHI family of brands was a proud sponsor of.  Well over 200 climbing wall owners, managers, routesetters, and other professionals were in attendance for the Summit, and GTHI partnered up with the <a href="http://www.thespotgym.com" target="_blank" >Spot Bouldering Gym</a> to host a night of climbing and good times. Climbers got a little crazy with trampoline jumps to the Spot boulders, enjoyed slackline demos, a huge raffle, and <a href="http://www.trango.com" target="_blank" >Trango's</a> own Malcolm Daly presenting a great slide show for the masses.</p>
						<p>Look out for e-Grips in one monthï¿½s time at the first ever <a href="http://www.tevamountaingames.com/ev_climb.cfm" target="_blank">Bouldering World Cup</a> held on US soil at the Teva Mountain Games in Vail, Colorado.  For a moment, we will forsake humility and ask you to consider the GREAT PROWESS of e-Grips - 3 out of 5 of e-Grips professional setters will be there to set the event!</p>
						<p>AND&hellip; Check out the 9 NEW sets just added to the website, as well as four new e-Grips profiled setters soon to come!</p>

					<p> e-Grips Finals problems create incredible movement for top pro climbers.</p>
					<p>This past weekend in e-Grips home of Boulder, Colorado, the ABS Adult, Youth, and Citizens Nationals were a great success.  Held at the Spot Bouldering Gym and CATS, the infamous training center for strong climbers, the competitions collectively hosted over 500 competitors and thousands of spectators in total, over three days.  e-Grips represented in full force, with the newest eG Team Setter Kynan Waggoner head setting perhaps the best event heï¿½s ever been a part of.  Jamie Emerson, fresh off of a road trip all over the east and south, and on his way to Switzerland for two months (check out his blog www.b3bouldering.com), created some exceptional toe-hook madness movement on e-Grips Menï¿½s Final 4.  Local Paul Robinson beat out the legend, Chris Sharma, to win the menï¿½s event, with Alex Puccio slightly edging Alex Johnson for top spot among the women.</p>
					<p>eG Head Setter Chris Danielson ran the Citizensï¿½ National at CATS with owner Rob Candelaria, setting some crushingly difficult problems that will challenge climbers for years to come on CATS newly refurbished walls.  And all of the other team setters playing a role as well - Mike Moelter spent much of the weekend on the mic, exciting the screaming crowd and energizing climbers to pull down hard, and veteran eG Team Setter Lance Hadfield rounded out the crew by WINNING the Masterï¿½s category at the Citizensï¿½ National!</p>
					<p>The e-Grips problems featured some of the coolest eG shapes, including the old school Papa Turtle Shell, the Myorcan Tufas and newer sets like the 2Tex Pure Crimps, the Bubble Wrap Ledges, Armordillo, and recent amazing First Dibs sets (soon to be available to the public) including the Demi-Loaves, Peabody Flakes, and C-Turtles.</p>
					<p>e-Grips continues to set the standard!  Look out soon for new eG Profiled Setter interviews from veteran competitor and setter Diane Russell, and experienced comp setter and coach Joe Czerwinski, who just had an excellent performance at ABS Nationals!</p>

					<p>Among the new Pure line additions, weï¿½ve heard the -2Tex Pure Crimps called the best competition crimps on the market.  The -2Tex Stealth Edges are sleek and devious.  And the -Pure Line Finger Buckets, shaped after high demand from the setting community, are superbly functionally simple.  </p>
					<p>Existing themes in the Artistic line have been filled out with the -Tribal Mini-Jugs, -Drop Art Mini-Jugs, -Bubble Wrap Obliques, and Bubble Wrap Ledges I.  The ABS 9 sponsorship set of edge/pinches called -Lunar Flats adds to the moon scoop theme, with more to come in 2008.

					<p>There was a recent firestorm of routesetting at a new gym in the South called <a href="http://www.trianglerockclub.com" target="blank">Triangle Rock Club</a>.  eG Setter Chris Danielson turned a long December weekend into a hugely successful USA Climbing Level 1 Routesetting Clinic, instructing wrench-turning and climbing movement to over 30 routesetters young and old from 10 different states across the country.  eG was proud to put up the first sponsorship banner in what will become a major gym in the region.</p>
					<p>Weï¿½re also proud to announce our first round of eG Profiled Setters from all over the states: Master gym setter Kyle Musgrove from Tennessee, Constantly traveling wrench twister Jackie Hueftle from Colorado, prolific shaper Louie Anderson from California and comp setting queen Molly Beard up in Oregon.  Look out soon for the updated e-Grips Team page with interviews from each of these talented setters, who we hooked up with eG exclusive holds and new threads.</p>
					<p>Happy Holidays!</p>

					<p><b>This fall has been so crazy that we didnï¿½t even have time to update info on all the sick developments at e-Grips!  Hereï¿½s a short recap of highlights:</b><br/><p><b>Routesetting -</b> Weï¿½re proud to announce that USA Climbing Routesetter and Operations Assistant <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/setters/#waggoner" >Kynan Waggoner</a> has joined the e-Grips Professional Setting Team!  Kynan has been setting for almost a decade, and recent conquests include gigs as Head Setter for ABS Youth Nationals and organizer for the Teva Games.  Kynan, and e-Grips Team veteran <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/setters/#moelter" >Mike Moelter</a> spent some time in Ecuador in August, where they participated in an IFSC (International Federation of Sport Climbing) Routesetting Clinic and set for the wild Youth World Championships, where US kids flooded the global stage and performed extremely well.</p>
			<p>
			eG is energetic about our support for routesetters around the country.  In that vein, weï¿½ll soon be starting a ï¿½Profiled Routesetterï¿½ web page and each month will be selecting a setter from around the US who stands out.  Weï¿½re looking for motivated talent and experience ï¿½ guys and girls that get it done, whether in commercial gyms or comps, and who are always trying to come up with new movement.  If youï¿½re doing something especiale in the routesetting world, give a shout to eG Head Setter <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/setters/#danielson" >Chris Danielson</a>.  If youï¿½re profiled, eG will hook you up with a fresh new eG jacket, a tee shirt, a free set of exclusive holds, and a one-time discount on e-Grips holds for your gym!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Apparel -</b> What?!  New schwag?!  YES!  eG has new limited edition t-shirts and jackets in honor of the hugely popular "<a href="http://www.e-grips.com/features/buddha.html" >Buddha</a>" feature hold.  We decided this artistry was too cool for just urethane, so we did some screen-printing for the masses with supra dupra new Marc Russo designs.  The ï¿½enlightenedï¿½ and eG ï¿½tribalï¿½ designs will be available soon on the website, in Menï¿½s and Womenï¿½s flavor - but if you want to be ahead of the curve - Contact Us and weï¿½ll get you set up with gear before it runs out!  </p>
			<p>
			<b>Comps -</b> Along with supplying some grips for the Youth Worlds, eG stepped up to sponsor the Mammut-EMS Bouldering Championships at the SLC trade show back in August.  eG Head Setter <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/setters/#danielson" >Chris Danielson</a> helped set the event, getting some incredible new dual tex crimps and a monster slope called the Armordillo on the sick walls of <a target="blank" href="http://www.frontslc.com/">The Front Climbing Club</a> in SLC.  Look out for e-Grips at events big and small all over the US this comp season, with new sets at every American Bouldering Series event.  Chris will be out and about this fall at the HP 40 and LRC Triple Crown Events, and instructing Routesetting Clinics on the east coast!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shapes -</b> Of course, new shapes are always coming in.  Along with the Armordillo feature, thereï¿½s the Finish Plate feature, and some very cool jug and edge lines.  Oh, and half a dozen hold sets that were shaped last year for the First Dibs program are now available in the full line, along with the sick ABS 8 Set.  <a href="#" onclick="javascript: alert('Coming Soon!')">Check out the new shapes here!</a>

					<font style="color: #999999; text-decoration:none;">July 18th 2007</font>
					</div><a href="javascript: void(0);" onclick="return GB_showFullScreenSet(page_set4, 1)"><img src="images/news/scs-youth-07.gif" align=left style="margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px;"></a>e-Grips Team Setter <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/setters/index.html#moelter">Mike Moelter</a> recently returned from setting one of the biggest events of his routesetting career.  Read his coverage of the amazingly successful 2007 SCS Junior Nationals: <br/>&nbsp;<br/>
					"1st PCA, 1st Petzl Rock Comp, 2007 SCS Jr. Nationals.  This list, in no particular order, is of the top three best large comps I have set for. A few years ago I would have never imagined that a Jr. event would be in my top three, and this was a rope event at that.
					<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
					The main goal at Jr. Nationals is to create and try to prepare Team USA for Jr. Worlds. This yearï¿½s event was held at Planet Rock, Ann Arbor Michigan.  It is no easy task to have 415 Jr. competitors show up for a comp and tell them we can only take 50 to compete at Worlds. At the same time, as a setter, you want to throw things at climbers that they will encounter on the international scene. Volumes, tufas, stalactites, & tons of natural features are the norm and have now been incorporated into USA Climbingï¿½s National events. If Team USA has ever been prepared for anything the international scene could throw at them, this was the year. The setters had 7 large fiberglass volumes, 2 stalactites, one of which was 15 ft. long and any number of wood volumes that could be made on the spot. It was truly the first time setting in the states that I felt we had evolved and entered a new arena. It also made us as a setting crew really nervous as to how the climbers would react.
					<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
					Of course with this many wall features there were some climbers that just could not either get the right psych or beta to handle the features. I know for a fact when you come out for route preview and the setters have put some sort of giant blob on a wall that you have never scene before it can be intimidating. Keep in mind this is a one try only event. You do not get 5 minutes to fall as many times as you can and still give it that one more effort to figure out the beta, itï¿½s the HAMMER, either clip the chains or take the whip. Overall though my hat goes off to all the National competitors and their performances, they truly prevailed and realize that if we want to rule the podium at Jr. Worlds this is what Nationals needs to climb like.
					<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
					From coaches to parents, staff to volunteers, USA Climbing and the competitors, the amount of time and resources spent on everyoneï¿½s part is tremendous and then there is the host gym. Planet Rock owned and (very much so) operated by Nick Cocciolone was an amazing host gym for this years Jr. National. I have never had a gym owner build me things to help aid in the course setting - whether it was a ramp so ladders could sit level or an outdoor speed wall he can and was willing to do it all. Props to Nick and his entire crew at <a href="javascript: void(0);" onclick="return GB_showFullScreenSet(page_set4, 1)">P-Rock</a>.
					<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
					Team USA will be headed down to Ibarra, Ecuador for this years Jr. Worlds. Kynan Waggoner and I will be headed down also for an international setters clinic. We hope to become internationally certified so we can open the doors to any US setter aspiring to set for international events. We will keep you posted on how it goes."

Part climber summer camp, part high level bouldering comp - by all accounts, the event was a huge success.  Organized by the boys behind <a href="#" onclick="return GB_showFullScreenSet(page_set3, 1)">NE2C</a> (<a href="#" onclick="return GB_showFullScreenSet(page_set3, 1)">www.boulderingcomps.com</a>), the comp took place at the new <a href="#" onclick="return GB_showFullScreenSet(page_set3, 2)">Adventure Sports Center International</a> (<a href="#" onclick="return GB_showFullScreenSet(page_set3, 2)">www.adventuresportscenter.com</a>) in McHenry, MD at a super cool venue with a custom built comp wall and amazing whitewater center, which more than a few of the pro climbers got bashed around by.<br/><br/>
e-Grips was there as a hold sponsor and Team Setter <a href="http://www.e-grips.com/setters/">Chris Danielson</a> went out to represent and see what the show was all about.  Though the whole East coast team acknowledged that things looked ominous the day before, the weather was perfect on Saturday for the event.  The action was fierce between the best competitors in the US, and one stylish monster climber from Canada, Sean McColl.  In the end McColl took first, flashing all four problems, though the amazing Daniel Woods was only a foot slip behind.  For the women, it was Lizzy Asher flashing, followed up by Angie Payne, who after a strong effort, also sent all four problems.<br /><br />Check out some e-Grips exclusive shots from the comp!  Thanks to Angie Payne for the camera!<br /><br />
