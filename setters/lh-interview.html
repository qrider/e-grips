		<br/>
		<div id="iv-question">How long have you been setting and climbing?</div><br/>
		"I have been climbing for over twenty five years. I set my first competition about 20 years ago."

		<br/><br/>

<div id="iv-question">How did you learn?</div><br/>

"I started route setting by teaching myself as there weren’t as many setters and gyms when I started. I really enjoy working with other setters and for competitions to experience new styles, ideas and techniques."
<br/><br/>

<div id="iv-question">What do you most enjoy about setting?</div><br/><br/>

"My favorite event that I was a part of was setting for Junior Nationals 2007. I also enjoyed setting the Division Two Championships."
<br/><br/>

<div id="iv-question">What makes a "good" routesetter?</div><br/><br/>

"I think a good route setter is someone who is willing to take feedback, give feedback, and is always willing to try to improve on a route or boulder problem that they have set."
<br/><br/>

<div id="iv-question">What do you think makes YOU a "good" routesetter? What would your friends say?</div><br/><br/>

"What makes me a good route setter is that I enjoy using good holds and creative body movement to make things hard to read and entertaining to try. I am also willing to admit when a problem is bad or not fun. I am always willing to make the necessary changes to improve the problem or make it fun."
<br/><br/>

<div id="iv-question">Where have you, or do you, set?</div><br/><br/>

"I have been the Head setter/Manager for Stone Age for ten years. I love my job and the people I work with."
<br/><br/>

<div id="iv-question">Do you have any favorite moves or problems that you’ve set?</div><br/><br/>

"I enjoy problems I set when I get to build volumes, tweak or modify holds that surprise competitors."
<br/><br/>

<div id="iv-question">What is your favorite e-Grips set?</div><br/><br/>

"My favorite e-grip holds are the loaves and bubble wraps. My second favorite sets are the other e-grips holds."
<br/><br/>

<div id="iv-question">Favorite Unique Feature?</div><br/><br/>

"My favorite unique feature is the red box I constructed for USAC Divisionals in 2007"
<br/><br/>

<div id="iv-question">Finally, how would you describe what makes e-Grips handholds the best?</div><br/><br/>

"I think what makes e-grips the best hand holds are their artistic beauty, longevity, flexibility and overall quality."
